## Customer segments

Catering has various types of customers:

* Professional event planners who know what they are doing and want ease of planning.  
* Non-professional event planners who do not know what they are doing so often want (free) event planning advice.  
* Principle Individuals \- want to impress event attendees and are usually the ones paying for the catering. They must be satisfied even if they are not responsible for planning.  
* Event attendees who want good food and a pleasant social environment. The principal individuals want the event attendees to have a good experience at the event.

## Why the catering business is attractive

* catering has potentially big volume engagements (hundreds of attendees at catering events)  
* catering clients are less price sensitive (since they are catering special events like weddings or company parties)  
* catering leverages the Malawi's brand (people already know about the Malawi’s pizza restaurant)  
* catering utilizes the restaurant kitchen earlier in the day (when it would otherwise be underutilized)  
* catering has low overhead costs (not needing a Malawi's physical facility)  
* catering has higher profit margins than base restaurant  
* catering provides a great opportunity to promote Malawi's restaurant (attendees "taste testing" pizza)

## Disadvantages of the catering business:

* Catering is highly seasonal with chunky demand patterns (big spikes), and thus low utilization of assets such as the portable pizza oven. The case states that “Malawi’s was catering about ten events per year, mostly in the summer months with one or two in the winter.”  
* Non-professional event planners often want advice about event planning, which is like free consulting and takes up a lot of manager Dan Evans’ time. The case states that “the time Evans would spend with the client planning the event, which could take anywhere between 3 and 10 hours depending on the client’s needs.”  
* Catering is subject to tremendous variation in the venues provided by the customers. For example, one time Malawi’s catered a BYU Club event at a venue that had a long narrow curved driveway to get behind a building to the catering location. The Malawi’s employees showed up with the wood-fired oven trailer behind a truck. The driveway was so narrow and curved that it took the truck about a half-hour to back the truck into proper location, making the employees rush to get the pizzas ready in time for the event.

If Kent Beck decides to retain and expand the catering operation (which is attractive for reasons outlined above), he needs to make adjustments to improve the operating scale, which is the ability to expand the operation efficiently.  
The following are ways to possibly increase operational scale of catering:

* Scale is limited by large amounts of direct interaction.  
  * Malawi’s could provide a website for learning about catering options and requesting a catering engagement. Event planners can get as much (or little) information from the website as they would like.  This allows professional planners to be more efficient, and non-professional planners to get the guidance they need.  
  * Once a catering engagement is scheduled, Malawi’s could provide the client with an engagement information form to complete. The form would let the client specify details about the facility, the event date, the number of attendees, and what types of pizza offerings are desired. This form requires less personal interaction and is thus more efficient. However, this form may be difficult for some non-professional planners who may have questions about catering options.  
* Scale is limited by relying on Evans' expertise…  
  * Malawi’s could train Ed Jones or other employees in meeting with catering clients. If done well, this would have little impact on the client experience. It does require having more knowledgeable employees.  
  * Malawi’s could develop a standard set of offerings that does not rely on Evans' expertise, such as “Catering Package A” and “Catering Package B” etc. Clients could select from these pre-defined packages to simplify the planning process. However, this would be less able to handle extreme variations in client needs.  
* Scale is limited by physical resources, specifically one mobile oven…  
  * Malawi’s could purchase additional mobile ovens at some cost.  
  * Malawi’s could use the clients’ ovens or ovens already at the venue. However, this presents a risk of equipment problems since the oven is unknown, and it would take away the "brick oven" ambiance of using Malawi’s wood-fired oven.  
* Scale is limited by human resources (Malawi’s employees)  
  * Malawi’s could hire part-time catering employees. The challenge would be finding qualified and motivated part-time employees, otherwise hiring more employees might adversely impact quality.  
  * Malawi’s could use more customer labor, such as assembling their own pizzas. This presents a risk of relying on the skill level of customers, which could vary tremendously, and might lower customer perceptions of the perceived value of the service. (Customers value having Malawi's do the work for them, in a professional manner.) 

# Other Useful Case Facts...

- **Profitability**: Catering is explicitly called the "most profitable part of the restaurant operation." This is the strongest argument for keeping it and expanding it.
- **Operational Bottleneck (Dan Evans)**: The entire catering process hinges on Dan Evans. It relies on his personal "intuition, experience, and knowledge." Planning with clients can take him 3-10 hours. This is not scalable or replicable for a franchise model. This is the biggest weakness.
- **Franchising Goal**: The primary business goal is to franchise. Therefore, all processes, including catering, must be standardized and replicable without relying on a single highly-skilled individual like Evans.
- **Brand/Marketing Value**: Catering acts as a key marketing channel. They do almost no advertising and rely on "word-of-mouth and attendee experience." The mobile oven is an attraction and generates interest. This is a significant intangible benefit.
- **Process Inefficiencies**:
    - **Planning**: Evans is acting as an event planner for non-professional clients, which is time-consuming and outside the scope of catering.
    - **Logistics**: Recurring issues with venue access (parking, tight driveways) cause problems on the day of the event.
    - **Expectation Setting**: Miscommunication leads to customer dissatisfaction (e.g., the cleanup incident).
- **Untapped Revenue/Service Models**:
    - **Self-Catering (Jane Goodman)**: The request for par-cooked pizzas for a self-catered event suggests a new, lower-touch, and potentially scalable service line. Evans's concern was brand image if quality suffers.
    - **Oven Rental**: Customers have expressed interest in renting the mobile oven. This is another potential revenue stream.
- **Financial Details**:
    - The restaurant is healthy: broke even in Y1, strong revenue and EBITDA growth in Y2/Y3.
    - Catering pricing model: $100 flat fee + $8-$12 per plate + 19% gratuity. This seems profitable, especially since restaurant staff are used (low dedicated overhead).
- **Brand Risk**: The Jane Goodman incident shows that inflexibility and inability to scale can create negative word-of-mouth, harming the brand. Any expansion must maintain the high-quality image.
