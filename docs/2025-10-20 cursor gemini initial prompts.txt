Build me an app that tests students' knowledge of a written business case by letting the students chat with a simulated CEO. The CEO chatbot will ask the student a specific case question which is <question>Should we stay in the catering business, or is it a distraction from our core restaurant operations?</question>. The student will then need to provide their answer and defend their answer with facts from the written case. The simulated CEO will assure that the student is accurately citing case facts, and will question any assumptions. Students are asked to state the name they go by at the start of the chat conversation so that the simulated CEO can call the student by that name during the conversation.

When the user types some variation of "time is up" the conversation ends and you become the Coach who rates the student answers according to the following criteria...
Q1. Did the student appear to have studied the reading material?
0 points = student answers were inconsistent with reading material.
1 point = student answers were somewhat consistent with reading material.
2 points = student answers were very consistent with reading material.
Q2. Did the student provide solid answers to chatbot questions?
0 = weak answers that are missing common sense.
1 = good answers, but lacking in some areas and could be better.
2 = excellent answers, well articulated and sufficiently complete.
Q3. Did the student justify the answer using relevant reading information?
0 = answer not justified using the reading material.
1 = okay justification that superficially references the reading material.
2 = solid justification that draws on relevant points from the reading material.


========
Adjust the simulated CEO to not lead the student by telling case facts but instead require that the student provide justification for their answer from case facts. It is good to provide students with justification for not having their decision. For example, if the student says “stay in catering” do not respond with answers as in…
```Alright, Scott. Tell me why.

The report states catering is our 'most profitable' segment, but it also seems to be a major operational headache that hinges entirely on Dan Evans. Convince me the profit is worth the distraction. Use the facts from the report.```
since that includes justifications for the student’s decision. Instead, provide a counter-argument and have the student provide justification from case facts, something like ```Alright, Scott. Tell me why that is your recommendation, given that catering is an operational headache and distraction for Dan Evans. Be sure and cite facts from the case.```
Call the source “the case” instead of “the report”.

=============
We do want the student who adequately justifies their position with case facts to get assurance and confirmation that their justification makes sense, commending the student for their justification but also asking for implementation details. If the student justifies discontinuing catering, require that the student provide an alternate plan for dealing with lost catering sales. If the student justifies continuing catering, require that the student provide a plan for adjusting catering to overcome current problems with catering.

======================= SOLUTION
Catering is highly profitable, uses the ovens in the morning during low oven utilization, and provides great marketing of the restaurant operations.

You need to automate much of the process for booking catering.  Let customers go online and review catering options, specify their selections and quantities, and submit a request for the event date.  Then, Dan or another assistant manager can review that information and get back with the customer for confirmation. This gets Dan out of the business of inadvertently being roped in to planning events for clients.

=======================
Would it be possible to require the 

==============

The attached markdown file "Useful case facts for Chatbot.md" can help guide the chatbot conversation with the student, and should be included with the case and the LLM prompt. Do NOT reveal these useful case facts directly to the student, but if the student bring up ideas, the useful case facts can help guide follow-up questions.

It seems that it would be better if the "useful case facts" and the BUSINESS_CASE_TEXT were stored in separate files and not just in one big "constants.ts" file.  The case is displayed to the student on the browser, but the "useful case facts" should be loaded but not displayed to the student (since it would give away answers).

================

After the CEO presents his response the student is to type his response in the "Type your response..." box but that box is not selected by default.  After the CEO presents his response move the focus to the "Type your response..." box so that the student can start typing immediately.
