 Chat with CEO

The application only uses the 'gemini-2.5-pro' model which is state-of-the-art but slow. I would like the option of selecting a model to use for each given section from models listed in a "models" data table with fields:
* model_id
* model_name
* enabled (true if enabled, false if disabled)
* input_cost (cost per million input tokens)
* output_cost (cost per million output tokens)
* default (true if this is the default model)
Preload the table with...
model_id	model_name	input_cost	output_cost	default
gemini-2.5-pro	Gemini 2.5 Pro	1.25	10	false
gemini-2.5-flash	Gemini 2.5 Flash	0.3	2.50	true
gemini-2.5-flash-lite	Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite	0.1	0.4	false

Then, add two columns to the "sections" data table and to the "evaluations" data table: (provide me with the Supabase SQL)
* chat_model (which model_id to use for the CEO chat)
* super_model (which model_id to use for the supervisor coach evaluation)

The models from the "sections" data table will be selected from the options in the models data table. The selected models will then be used in the chat and supervisor evaluation workflows if the user has selected that section. If the user select some "other" section then the default model should be used.

During the simulation the chat_model should be appended to the tooltip for mouseover of the CEO "KB" circle. At the time the evaluation wait screen, the super_model should be unobtrusively displayed at the bottom of the screen.

At the conclusion of the evaluation, the chat_model and super_model used should be recorded in the "evaluations" data table, and reported in the "Instructor Dashboard" in two places:
* in the list of sections (showing models for the section)
* in the list of evaluations (showing which models were used in the chat and evaluations)
