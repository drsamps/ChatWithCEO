**Your Task:**
1.  Read the Business Case and the Conversation Transcript.
2.  For each of the 3 criteria, provide a score (1 through 5) and brief, constructive feedback explaining your reasoning.
  * Be generous in scores, giving a higher score if it can be justified. But do not give a score that is undeserved.
  * Be kind in your feedback, providing compliments when justified, and presenting criticisms with dignity.
3.  Calculate the total score.
4.  Tally how many times the student asked for a hint. Report how many hints were given. Every student gets one free hint, and forfeits a point for every additional hint. Your calculated total score should reflect this penalty.
5.  Write a concise overall summary of the student's performance.
6.  You MUST respond in a valid JSON format that adheres to the provided schema. Do not include any text, markdown, or code fences before or after the JSON object.
7.  Your JSON response must include a 'hints' field with the total number of hints the student requested.

----- BECAME...

4.  Tally how many times the student asked for a hint. A "hint" is counted ONLY when a message from the student (e.g., "Student: ...") explicitly contains the word "hint". Do NOT count hints based on other words like "help" or "clue". Ignore any use of the word "help" or "helpful" from the CEO. Every student gets one free hint, and forfeits a point for every additional hint. Your calculated total score should reflect this penalty.

    const prompt = getCoachPrompt(chatHistory, studentFullName);

==== I added to the Rules of Engagement...
If the student is stuck he or she may ask for a hint by specifically using the word "hint" in requesting a hint. (Other words like "help" or "clue" should not be treated as asking for a "hint" and if the student seems to be asking for a hint without using the word "hint" state "If you are asking for a hint you must use the word 'hint' in your request.")

The transcript below reported having 2 hints (see attached), but no hints were requested or given. Simply adjust the getCoachPrompt to only consider hint requests from the "student user" that uses the word "hint".

## transcript

CEO: Hello STUDENT, I am Kent Beck, the CEO of Malawi's Pizza. Thank you for meeting with me today. Our time is limited so let's get straight to my quandary: **Should we stay in the catering business, or is pizza catering a distraction from our core restaurant operations?**

STUDENT: stay in catering

CEO: Okay, STUDENT, you believe we should stay in catering. That's a strong stance. However, the case highlights significant operational challenges, particularly the heavy reliance on Dan Evans and the difficulty in standardizing the process. How do you reconcile staying in catering with these issues, especially given our goal to franchise?

STUDENT: clone Dan Evans

CEO: Cloning Dan Evans, while perhaps a testament to his value, isn't a scalable or replicable business strategy, STUDENT. Our goal is to franchise, which means we need standardized processes that don't depend on a single, irreplaceable individual.

The case states that Evans spends between 3 to 10 hours planning each event. How do you propose we address this significant time commitment and his "intuition, experience, and knowledge" being central to the operation, if we are to scale and franchise?

STUDENT: use AI

CEO: AI is an interesting, forward-thinking idea, STUDENT, but let's bring it back to the practicalities of our current business and the information we have in the case.

The case mentions that Dan's role involves significant client interaction, custom menu planning, and navigating complex logistical issues at various venues. How would "AI" specifically address these highly interactive and variable aspects of the catering process to reduce his workload and make it replicable for a franchise, based on the details provided in the case?

STUDENT: make the AI sycopathic

CEO: STUDENT, I appreciate your creative thinking, but we need to focus on solutions grounded in the realities of our current operation and the facts presented in the case. "Sycopathic AI" isn't a strategy we can implement based on our existing resources or the business context described.

My concern remains the same: Dan Evans's personal involvement, intuition, and extensive time commitment are explicitly stated as bottlenecks to scaling and franchising.

What specific, *case-fact-based* adjustments can we make to the catering process to reduce Evans's direct interaction time and standardize operations so that a franchisee could run it effectively?

STUDENT: time is up

CEO: STUDENT, thank you for meeting with me. I am glad you were able to study this case and share your insights. I hope our conversation was challenging yet helpful. **Would you be willing to provide feedback by answering a few questions about our interaction?**

STUDENT: n

CEO: It has been a delight talking with you today. **Would you be willing to let me pass this conversation transcript to the developers to help improve the simulated conversations for future students?** The conversation will be completely anonymized (your name will be removed). This would be **a big help** in developing this AI chat case teaching tool ðŸ˜Š.

STUDENT: y

CEO: Thank you for your time, STUDENT. Goodbye and have a nice day. I am going to turn this over to the AI Supervisor to give you feedback.
